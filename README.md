### Hi there, my name is Andrew Lin 👋

## About Me
I’m a 5th year student at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, having previously completed a BSc (Major in Computer Science, Minor in Data Analytics), as well as a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science; I’m currently broadening my perspective through studying social science papers, such as economics, politics and policy, and history.

My main interests lie in data analysis and modelling, and interdisciplinary reasoning, with a focus on integrating mixed methods, systems thinking, and diverse perspectives into understanding complex issues. 
I'm particularly interested in applying these skills across consulting, government, financial institutions, and think-tanks. I also have a strong technical background in cybersecurity and the cloud, AI/ML, software development, and embedded systems.

Outside university, I’m involved in leadership, volunteering, and student organisations, and I also enjoy travel, the outdoors, reading, gaming, and exploring new experiences and ideas.
