### Hi there, my name is Andrew Lin 👋

## About Me
I’m a 5th-year student at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, with a focus on data analysis, modelling, and interdisciplinary reasoning across economics, politics and policy, law, and history.

I previously completed a BSc (Major in Computer Science, Minor in Data Analytics) and a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science, and I’m now complementing this technical background with social science study to better understand complex issues using systems thinking and mixed-methods research.

I’m particularly interested in applying these skills across the public sector, consulting and research consultancies, think tanks, and financial institutions.

Outside university, I’m involved in leadership and volunteering through various organisations, and I enjoy travel, the outdoors, reading, and exploring new ideas.
