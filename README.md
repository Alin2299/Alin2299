I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, with a passion for continuous learning and improvement, including staying informed about new technologies and developments, and Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to real-world problem-solving and contribute to meaningful work.

My interests span various fields, including Data and Policy Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Security, and I am especially interested in exploring how technology intersects with areas such as Politics, Law, International Relations, and Bioinformatics.
