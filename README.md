### Hi there, my name is Andrew Lin ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, with a passion for continuous learning and improvement, including staying informed about new technologies and developments, and Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to real-world problem-solving and contribute to meaningful work.

My interests span various fields, including Data and Policy Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity, and I am especially interested in exploring interdisciplinary approaches; for example, how technology intersects with areas such as Politics, Law, International Relations, and Bioinformatics.

I am also passionate about leadership and community/civic engagement, having participated in numerous volunteering opportunities and clubs at the university, including with my current involvement with a New Zealand political party and the Waikato Political Science Students Association.
